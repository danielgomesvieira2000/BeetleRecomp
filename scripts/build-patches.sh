# Build the MIPS patches (patches/*.c -> patches/patches.elf).
#
# WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS
#
# Patches are C cross-compiled to MIPS, which needs an LLVM built with the MIPS backend. The
# Windows LLVM installed for the host build (22.1.8, via winget) does NOT have one — `llc --version`
# lists no MIPS target and `-target mips` fails outright with "No available targets are compatible
# with triple mips". That is not a flags problem and no amount of coaxing fixes it.
#
# Ubuntu's packaged clang does carry every target, so the patches are built in WSL exactly as the
# decomp is. clang-18 is used deliberately: BUILDING.md pins LLVM 18.1.8 because 19.x is documented
# as miscompiling MIPS, and Ubuntu ships precisely 18.1.8 as `clang-18`.
#
# One-time setup inside WSL:
#     sudo apt install -y clang-18 lld-18
#
# Usage (from Windows Git Bash, or natively on Linux):
#     scripts/build-patches.sh            # build
#     scripts/build-patches.sh clean      # clean
#
# Override the distro or the toolchain if your setup differs:
#     WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu-24.04 PATCH_CC=clang-18 PATCH_LD=ld.lld-18 scripts/build-patches.sh
